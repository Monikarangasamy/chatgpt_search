# India Heatmap Generator üó∫Ô∏è

A Python script that generates a geographic heatmap of India, visualizing per capita data for each state. This project uses the `geopandas` and `matplotlib` libraries to merge geospatial data with statistical information and create a visually appealing map.

-----

## Installation

Before running the script, you'll need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or notebook environment:

```bash
pip install geopandas pandas matplotlib mapclassify
```

## Usage

To generate the heatmap, you must have two data files and a shapefile of India. The paths to these files are specified in the script and need to be updated to match your local file structure.

1.  **Update File Paths:**

      - `shapefile_path`: Path to your India shapefile directory.
      - `data1_path`: Path to your first CSV file with state-wise data.
      - `data2_path`: Path to your second CSV file with state-wise data.

2.  **Run the Script**:
    Execute the `heatmap.py` script. The program will process the data, handle geospatial complexities (like merging the geometries of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh), and display the final heatmap.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
python heatmap.py
```

### Example

The script processes two CSV files and a shapefile to produce a final image like this: .

The generated heatmap will display states colored by their "Per\_Capita\_Stat" value, with state names and corresponding values overlaid on the map for easy interpretation.

## Features ‚ú®

  * **Geospatial Data Merging**: Combines statistical data from CSV files with geographical shapefiles.
  * **State Name Standardization**: Cleans and standardizes state names to ensure accurate data merging.
  * **Geometrical Unification**: Corrects the representation of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh by merging their geometries.
  * **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Generates a customizable heatmap with a color bar and state-specific labels.
  * **Automated Label Placement**: Uses offsets to prevent text labels from overlapping with state borders, improving readability.

-----

## Project Structure

The project has a simple structure, with all core logic contained within a single Python script.

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ heatmap.py
```

-----

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

  * **geopandas**: For working with geospatial data.
  * **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  * **matplotlib**: For creating the heatmap plot.
  * **mapclassify**: For classifying data into quantiles for plotting.
  * **shapely**: For geometric operations.
